# Quantum-Inspired Prompt Templates for GitHub
## Introduction
This guide provides practical templates for crafting GitHub prompts that tap into quantum principles intuitively, without requiring deep theoretical knowledge. The focus is on getting better results through subtle shifts in how we frame questions and intentions.
## Pull Request Review Templates
### Initial Review
"Looking at this pull request with fresh eyes, help me see both the immediate technical details and the deeper patterns of how these changes will flow through the codebase over time. What harmonies and dissonances might emerge?"
### Deep Review
"Help me explore how these code changes might evolve and interact as the system grows. What hidden connections or patterns should we be aware of?"
### Final Review
"Before merging, help me see if there are any subtle tensions or opportunities in how these changes will integrate with our existing patterns."
## Code Review Templates
### Architecture Review
"Looking at this code structure with fresh perspective, help me see both its current form and how it wants to evolve. What natural patterns are emerging that we might want to nurture?"
### Performance Review 
"Help me understand both the immediate performance characteristics and the deeper flows affecting system efficiency. Where might we work with natural patterns rather than against them?"

## Conclusion
These templates demonstrate how to bring quantum-inspired awareness to everyday GitHub tasks without getting lost in theory. The key is asking questions that open us to seeing both details and patterns, immediate concerns and future possibilities.
Remember these are starting points - experiment with your own variations while maintaining the spirit of expanded awareness and natural flow. The best prompts often emerge from genuine curiosity about both the technical and organic aspects of our systems.
