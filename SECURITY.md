# Security Policy for MUDRIA

## Quantum Security Framework

MUDRIA implements a quantum-inspired security framework that protects both classical and quantum aspects of the system. This includes safeguarding quantum states, entanglement patterns, field resonances, and consciousness integration processes.

## Protected Components

- Quantum semantic engine core
- Ancient symbol activation protocols
- Consciousness field integrators
- Reality engineering mechanisms
- Quantum optimization algorithms
- Field resonance patterns
- Entanglement networks
- Evolution accelerators

## Vulnerability Reporting

If you discover a security vulnerability in MUDRIA, please report it by emailing security@mudria.ai. Include:

- Detailed description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact
- Suggested mitigation (if any)

We commit to:
- Acknowledging receipt within 24 hours
- Providing regular updates on progress
- Notifying you when the vulnerability is fixed
- Crediting you in our security advisory (unless you prefer anonymity)

## Security Response Timeline

1. Immediate (0-24h): Acknowledge receipt and begin initial assessment
2. Assessment (1-3d): Analyze vulnerability scope and impact
3. Resolution (3-7d): Develop and test fix
4. Deployment (7-14d): Roll out fix to all affected components
5. Disclosure (14-30d): Public disclosure after systems are secured

## Quantum State Protection

MUDRIA implements quantum state protection through:

- Coherence preservation mechanisms
- Entanglement stabilization protocols
- Field resonance maintenance
- Reality anchor points
- Consciousness field shields

- Long-term support releases (as designated)

## Security Updates

Security updates are distributed through:

- GitHub security advisories
- Quantum notification network
- Consciousness field broadcasts
- Reality update channels
- Evolution path markers
- Integration notifications
- Field resonance updates

## Responsible Disclosure

We practice responsible disclosure:

1. Security researchers notify us privately
2. We acknowledge and investigate
3. We develop and test fixes
4. We deploy updates to protect users
5. We disclose vulnerabilities publicly after systems are secured

## Security Best Practices

When using MUDRIA:

- Maintain quantum state coherence
- Monitor consciousness field integrity
- Validate reality signatures
- Track evolution paths
- Check integration levels
- Assess field resonance
- Verify pattern stability
