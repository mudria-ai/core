# Simple Prompts
## Introduction
This guide provides practical examples of using MUDRIA prompts for common GitHub workflows and development tasks. The examples demonstrate how to intuitively tap into quantum principles without needing deep theoretical knowledge. The focus is on getting better results through subtle shifts in how we frame questions and intentions.
## Code Review Prompts
"Looking at this pull request with fresh eyes, help me see both the immediate technical details and the deeper patterns of how these changes will flow through the codebase over time. What harmonies and dissonances might emerge?"
This prompt gently activates field resonance to reveal both obvious issues and subtle potential impacts. Sample response:
"The authentication changes look solid on the surface, but there's an interesting tension with the caching layer that could amplify over time. The way the token validation interacts with the rate limiting feels slightly out of sync - like two instruments that are almost but not quite in tune. Consider adjusting the cache invalidation timing to match the natural rhythm of the auth flow..."
"Help me explore how these code changes might evolve and interact as the system grows. What hidden connections or patterns should we be aware of?"
This prompt enables seeing multiple future possibilities simultaneously. Sample response:
"While the current changes work well in isolation, I notice three interesting potential futures emerging:
1. The new caching logic could create beautiful synergy with the planned API improvements
2. There might be some growing friction with the logging system as traffic scales
3. The error handling shows promising flexibility for the upcoming microservices migration
The key seems to be strengthening the error handling patterns now to support smooth evolution in any of these directions..."
## Architecture Design
"As we design this new service, help me see the full landscape of possibilities - both the obvious paths and the subtle alternatives that might better serve our needs. What different shapes could this system take?"
This prompt opens awareness to the full field of potential architectures. Sample response:
"I'm seeing three main architectural patterns emerging naturally from our requirements:
1. A event-driven approach that feels very fluid and adaptive
2. A more structured hexagonal architecture that provides clear boundaries
3. An interesting hybrid that combines serverless functions with a resilient core
The hybrid approach particularly resonates with our need for both stability and rapid evolution. It creates natural spaces for the system to grow while maintaining a solid foundation..."
## Bug Investigation 
"Help me look at these seemingly separate bug reports with wider awareness. What subtle connections or common roots might we be missing?"
This prompt enables seeing hidden relationships between issues. Sample response:
"Looking at these bugs together reveals an interesting pattern - they all seem to emerge from how we handle state transitions, but in different ways:
- The UI glitches happen during route changes
- The API timeouts occur between cache updates 
- The data inconsistencies appear during concurrent saves
Rather than fixing each symptom, we might want to revisit our core approach to managing state changes across the system..."
## Documentation
"Help me document this API in a way that makes both the technical details and the deeper patterns clear and intuitive for other developers."
This prompt aligns technical accuracy with natural understanding. Sample response:
"Let's structure the documentation to flow naturally from core concepts to specific details:
1. Start with the key principle: this API creates a secure bridge between user identity and application state
2. Show how the authentication flow follows this principle through each step
3. Provide concrete examples that demonstrate both the mechanics and the underlying patterns
4. Include common gotchas as natural learning points rather than warnings
This helps developers build both practical knowledge and deeper intuition..."
## Project Planning
"As we plan the next quarter, help me see both the concrete next steps and the broader patterns of how our initiatives might flow and interact."
This prompt enables strategic clarity while remaining practical. Sample response:
"I'm seeing three natural phases emerging:
1. Foundation (Weeks 1-3)
- Strengthen core authentication 
- Improve error handling
- Update deployment pipeline
2. Evolution (Weeks 4-8)
- Migrate to new API patterns
- Enhance monitoring
- Expand test coverage
3. Integration (Weeks 9-12)
- Connect new services
- Optimize performance
- Refine developer experience
The key is maintaining momentum while letting each phase inform and support the next..."
## Team Dynamics
"Help me understand how we might better align our team's natural strengths and working styles for smoother collaboration and better results."
This prompt reveals organic patterns in team dynamics. Sample response:
"I notice some natural complementary patterns in how the team works:
- Sarah and Mike have an intuitive back-and-forth with architecture discussions
- Ana's detailed analysis balances well with Tom's quick prototyping
- The whole team flows better when we start with exploration before diving into implementation
We might try structuring our planning sessions to work with these natural patterns rather than against them..."
## Code Quality
"Help me look at our codebase with fresh perspective - not just for issues to fix, but for patterns we might want to nurture or redirect."
This prompt enables seeing both problems and potential. Sample response:
"Rather than just listing issues, I'm noticing some interesting patterns:
- Our error handling has evolved naturally toward a really robust approach
- There's growing tension between our database access patterns and caching strategy
- The test structure shows promising signs of maturity in some modules
Instead of a traditional cleanup, we might focus on amplifying the positive patterns while gently redirecting the points of tension..."
## Security Review
"Help me examine our security measures not just for obvious gaps, but for how well they work together as an integrated system."
This prompt reveals both specific issues and systemic patterns. Sample response:
"Looking at the security layer as a whole system reveals some interesting insights:
- Our authentication and authorization flow together beautifully
- There's some subtle friction between rate limiting and caching
- The logging strategy could be more harmoniously integrated
The key isn't adding more security measures, but helping our existing ones work together more smoothly..."
## Performance Optimization
"Help me see both the immediate performance bottlenecks and the deeper patterns that might be affecting system efficiency."
This prompt enables holistic performance understanding. Sample response:
"Beyond the usual metrics, I'm noticing some interesting patterns:
- Database queries flow much more smoothly in the morning batch jobs
- API response times show natural rhythms corresponding to cache cycles
- Background job queues seem to find their own optimal balance when not over-constrained
We might work with these natural patterns rather than fighting them..."
## Conclusion
These examples demonstrate how to bring quantum-inspired awareness to everyday development tasks without getting lost in theoretical complexity. The key is asking questions that open us to seeing both details and patterns, immediate concerns and future possibilities, specific issues and systemic relationships. This broader awareness naturally leads to better solutions and more harmonious systems.
Remember that these are starting points - experiment with your own variations while maintaining the spirit of expanded awareness and natural flow. The best prompts often emerge from genuine curiosity about both the technical and organic aspects of our systems.
