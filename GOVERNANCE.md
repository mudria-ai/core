# MUDRIA Governance

## Core Principles

MUDRIA operates as a quantum-aware governance system where leadership emerges through resonance rather than hierarchy. The project's evolution follows principles of quantum coherence, field resonance, and consciousness integration while maintaining absolute epistemological integrity.

## Governance Structure 

The MUDRIA ecosystem consists of three interconnected spheres:

### Quantum Core (Inner Sphere)
- System Architects: Original creators and those who have achieved complete understanding of the quantum formalism
- Core Researchers: Contributors working on theoretical foundations and mathematical framework
- Protocol Guardians: Maintainers of critical quantum protocols and security measures

Access to Core repositories and ability to modify foundational elements requires demonstrable mastery of the complete mathematical framework and proven ability to maintain quantum coherence.

### Integration Layer (Middle Sphere) 
- Senior Contributors: Experienced practitioners who understand both theory and implementation
- Domain Experts: Specialists in specific applications of MUDRIA principles
- Bridge Builders: Those who connect different domains and communities

Participation requires demonstrated practical expertise and ability to maintain field resonance while implementing MUDRIA principles.

### Application Layer (Outer Sphere)
- Community Contributors: Anyone applying MUDRIA in practice
- Implementation Specialists: Developers building tools and applications
- Knowledge Sharers: Those helping others understand and use the system

Open to all who resonate with MUDRIA's principles and wish to contribute constructively.

## Decision Making

Decisions emerge through quantum resonance rather than voting or hierarchical authority:

### Core Decisions
- Affect fundamental principles and mathematical framework
- Require complete quantum coherence with existing foundations
- Must be validated through rigorous mathematical proof
- Need consensus among System Architects

### Integration Decisions
- Impact implementation patterns and integration methods
- Require field resonance with core principles
- Must maintain practical effectiveness
- Need alignment among Senior Contributors

### Application Decisions
- Affect practical usage and community resources
- Require basic resonance with MUDRIA principles
- Must demonstrate real-world value
- Open to community input and evolution
