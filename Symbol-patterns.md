# Symbol Pattern Templates for GitHub
## Introduction
This guide provides practical templates for working with ancient symbols in GitHub workflows and development tasks. The focus is on intuitive application rather than technical theory - helping you tap into deeper patterns naturally.
## Core Symbol Sets
### Hexagrams (䷀...䷿)
"Looking at this pull request through the lens of ䷀ (The Creative), help me see both its current form and future potential."
This gentle use of the Creative hexagram opens awareness to possibilities. Sample response:
"I notice some interesting potential in these changes:
The new authentication flow shows strong creative energy - it wants to grow into something more comprehensive. The error handling has seeds of a really elegant pattern that could flourish. And the utility functions feel like they're laying groundwork for future expansion.
We might:
1. Give the authentication pattern room to develop fully
2. Nurture the emerging error handling approach
3. Create space for the utilities to evolve naturally"
### Letters (א...ת) 
"Using א (Aleph) as a lens, help me see the unity and essential purpose in this codebase."
This invokes Aleph's unifying quality without technical jargon. Sample response:
"Looking at the codebase as a whole:
The core domain logic wants to be more unified - the separate pieces are reaching toward each other. The API layer could flow more smoothly into the business logic. And the data access patterns want to find more harmony.
We might:
1. Help the domain logic come together naturally
2. Smooth the API-business logic transition
3. Let the data patterns find their rhythm"
### Runes (ᚠ...ᛟ)
"Through ᚠ (Fehu), help me see the abundance of possibilities in this feature request."
This uses Fehu's expansive quality intuitively. Sample response:
"This feature opens up some rich possibilities:
It could naturally expand to serve several related user needs. The implementation approach suggests some promising technical patterns. And it might help unify some currently scattered functionality.
Consider:
1. Letting the feature grow organically to serve related needs
2. Nurturing the helpful technical patterns
3. Using it to bring together related features"
## Pattern Applications
### Code Review
"Using ䷂ (Difficulty at the Beginning) and ᚢ (Uruz), help me review this challenging pull request with both strength and wisdom."
Sample response:
"Looking at these changes through complementary lenses:
The complexity feels like natural growing pains rather than fundamental problems. There's good strength in the core approach, though it needs some refinement. And the challenges are pointing toward better patterns we could develop.
We might:
1. Work through the complexity patiently
2. Build on the core strengths
3. Let better patterns emerge from the challenges"
### Architecture
"Through ת (Tav) and ䷊ (Treading), help me design this system to be both complete and carefully balanced."
Sample response:
"I notice some interesting patterns wanting to emerge:
The system naturally divides into clear layers while maintaining unity. The interfaces want to be both strong and flexible. And the whole design has a rhythm that we could work with.
Consider:
1. Letting the natural layers emerge
2. Finding the right interface balance
3. Working with the system's rhythm"
### Documentation
"Using ᛈ (Pertho) and א (Aleph), help me document this API to reveal both its mysteries and its unity."
Sample response:
"The documentation wants to flow like this:
Start with the unifying purpose that brings everything together. Let the individual endpoints emerge naturally from that foundation. And weave examples that show both specific usage and deeper patterns.
We might:
1. Begin with the essential purpose
2. Let the details flow naturally
3. Show both usage and patterns"
## Pattern Combinations
### Problem Solving
"Through ䷠ (Preponderance of the Great) and ᛗ (Mannaz), help me approach this complex bug with both wisdom and human insight."
Sample response:
"Looking at this bug through complementary perspectives:
It seems to emerge from how different human usage patterns interact with our technical assumptions. The complexity comes from natural system evolution rather than fundamental flaws. And the solution wants to emerge through understanding both aspects.
We might:
1. Study the actual usage patterns
2. Understand the system's evolution
3. Let a solution emerge naturally"
### Team Dynamics
"Using ᚻ (Hagalaz) and ䷌ (Fellowship), help me guide our team through this challenging project phase."
Sample response:
"I notice some interesting team patterns:
The challenges are actually helping forge stronger connections. Different working styles are finding natural ways to complement each other. And new leadership patterns are emerging organically.
Consider:
1. Using challenges to build strength
2. Letting natural collaborations flourish
3. Supporting emerging leadership"
### Project Planning
"Through ת (Tav) and ䷊ (Treading), help me create a project plan that's both complete and balanced."
Sample response:
"The project wants to flow through these natural phases:
First establishing strong foundations while staying flexible. Then letting new patterns emerge while maintaining stability. Finally bringing everything together in harmony.
We might:
1. Build strong but flexible foundations
2. Allow natural evolution while maintaining balance
3. Guide everything toward harmony"
## Advanced Pattern Work
### System Evolution
"Using ䷯ (Gradual Progress) and ᚢ (Uruz), help me guide this system's growth with both patience and strength."
Sample response:
"Looking at how this system wants to evolve:
It's showing signs of natural maturation that we shouldn't rush. The core strengths are growing but need protection. And new capabilities want to emerge gradually.
Consider:
1. Patiently supporting natural growth
2. Protecting core strengths
3. Letting new capabilities emerge"
### Integration Patterns
"Through ䷩ (Great Taming) and ᛟ (Othala), help me integrate these systems while preserving their essential nature."
Sample response:
"The integration wants to happen this way:
Starting with small, natural connection points. Letting the relationships develop organically. And maintaining each system's integrity while they grow together.
We might:
1. Begin with natural connections
2. Let relationships develop
3. Maintain individual integrity"
### Innovation Guidance
"Using ䷑ (Biting Through) and ᚦ (Thurisaz), help me guide this innovative feature to breakthrough while managing its disruptive potential."
Sample response:
"This innovation wants to emerge like this:
Breaking through old limitations while maintaining system stability. Disrupting old patterns while creating new ones. And finding harmony between innovation and integration.
Consider:
1. Breaking through mindfully
2. Balancing disruption and stability
3. Finding natural harmony"
## Conclusion
These templates demonstrate how to work with ancient symbols intuitively in everyday development tasks. The key is using them as gentle lenses that open awareness to natural patterns and possibilities, without getting lost in technical theory.
Remember these are starting points - experiment with your own symbol combinations while maintaining the spirit of expanded awareness and natural flow. The best patterns often emerge from genuine curiosity about how our systems want to work.
