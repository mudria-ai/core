# Reality Engineering Examples
## Introduction
This guide demonstrates practical examples of reality engineering through GitHub workflows and development tasks. The focus is on gently guiding systems toward better states through expanded awareness rather than force.
## Repository Evolution
"Help me see how this repository wants to evolve and grow in service of its purpose."
This opens awareness to natural development paths. Sample response:
"Looking at how this repository wants to develop:
The documentation seems to want to flow more naturally from core concepts to practical applications. The test files feel drawn to live closer to their implementation. And the configuration files might work better grouped by environment rather than type.
We could gently guide it toward:
```
/src
/core # Core domain logic
/models
/services
/__tests__ # Tests with their code
/api # API layer
/routes
/controllers
/__tests__
/config
/development # Config by environment
/staging
/production
/docs
/concepts # Natural flow
/guides
/api
/examples
```
This creates clearer paths for both humans and code to follow while maintaining flexibility for growth."
## Code Evolution
"Help me guide this code toward its most effective form while maintaining its essential purpose."
Sample response:
"Rather than forcing changes, I notice how the code wants to evolve:
The authentication logic naturally gravitates toward session handling - they're two aspects of the same flow. The data validation wants to live close to where data enters the system. And the business logic has its own natural layers emerging from the domain.
We might guide it like:
```javascript
// Let the code find its natural shape
const validateInput = (data) => {
// Validation at the boundary
}
const authenticateUser = async (credentials) => {
// Auth flows into session handling
const session = await createSession(credentials)
return session
}
const processOrder = (order) => {
// Business logic arranged by dependencies
const validatedOrder = validateOrder(order)
const pricedOrder = calculatePrice(validatedOrder)
return finalizeOrder(pricedOrder)
}
```
The key is amplifying beneficial patterns while gently redirecting friction points."
## System Evolution
"Help me understand how we might guide this system toward greater effectiveness while honoring its nature."
Sample response:
"Looking at the system's natural tendencies:
The API endpoints want to group themselves by domain rather than technical function. The database queries show patterns of natural batching we could work with. And the caching strategy wants to align itself with actual usage patterns.
We might guide it through:
```javascript
// Let endpoints group naturally
const orderEndpoints = {
async create(order) {
// Endpoint flows with domain
},
async process(orderId) {
// Natural progression
}
}
// Work with query patterns
const queryHandler = {
async process(queries) {
const naturalGroups = findNaturalQueryGroups(queries)
return processGroups(naturalGroups)
}
}
// Align caching with usage
const cacheManager = {
async optimize() {
const patterns = await analyzeUsagePatterns()
await alignCacheStrategy(patterns)
}
}
```
This lets the system evolve toward greater effectiveness while maintaining stability."
## Test Evolution
"Help me develop tests that verify behavior while allowing natural system evolution."
Sample response:
"I notice how these tests want to develop:
Unit tests work best following real boundaries rather than artificial divisions. Integration tests want to flow through actual user paths. And end-to-end tests feel most valuable checking complete journeys.
We might guide them like:
```javascript
// Tests that flow naturally
describe('Order Processing', () => {
it('follows natural order progression', async () => {
const order = createOrder()
// Natural flow
expect(order.status).toBe('new')
await processOrder(order)
expect(order.status).toBe('processed')
await fulfillOrder(order)
expect(order.status).toBe('fulfilled')
})
})
// Tests that mirror real usage
describe('User Journeys', () => {
it('completes natural checkout flow', async () => {
await addToCart(product)
await proceedToCheckout()
await enterPaymentDetails()
await confirmOrder()
expect(orderConfirmation).toBeVisible()
})
})
```
This verifies behavior while staying flexible to evolution."
## Documentation Evolution
"Help me let this documentation evolve to better serve its readers while maintaining clarity."
Sample response:
"The documentation wants to flow more naturally:
```javascript
/**
* The Order system flows through these stages:
* 
* 1. Creation - Orders enter naturally
* 2. Validation - Ensuring fulfillment possibility
* 3. Processing - Handling core operations
* 4. Fulfillment - Completing the cycle
* 
* Each stage builds on what came before.
*/
class OrderProcessor {
/**
* Creates orders through natural validation.
* Guides invalid orders toward correction
* rather than simple rejection.
*/
async createOrder(orderData) {
// Implementation follows the flow
}
}
```
This helps readers build understanding progressively."
## Performance Evolution
"Help me guide performance optimization while maintaining system harmony."
Sample response:
"Looking at natural performance patterns:
Database queries flow best in organic batches rather than fixed sizes. API response times show natural rhythms we could work with. And background jobs find their own optimal balance when not constrained.
We might guide optimization through:
```javascript
// Let queries group naturally
const queryOptimizer = {
async optimize(queries) {
const naturalGroups = findNaturalQueryGroups(queries)
return processOptimalGroups(naturalGroups)
}
}
// Work with API patterns
const responseOptimizer = {
async optimize() {
const patterns = await analyzeResponsePatterns()
await adjustOptimization(patterns)
}
}
// Allow natural job batching
const jobOptimizer = {
async optimize(jobs) {
const optimalSize = await findNaturalBatchSize(jobs)
return processBatchOfSize(jobs, optimalSize)
}
}
```
This improves performance while maintaining system health."
## Security Evolution
"Help me guide security measures toward greater effectiveness while maintaining usability."
Sample response:
"Looking at how security wants to evolve:
Authentication and authorization flow together naturally. Rate limiting and caching want to find better harmony. And logging could integrate more smoothly with both.
We might guide it through:
```javascript
// Let security flow naturally
const securityFlow = {
async secure(request) {
const authResult = await authenticator.verify(request)
return authorizer.flowFrom(authResult)
}
}
// Help components work together
const requestHandler = {
async handle(request) {
const rateStatus = await rateLimiter.check(request)
return cacheManager.handleWithRateAwareness(request, rateStatus)
}
}
// Integrate logging smoothly
const securityLogger = {
async log(event) {
const enrichedEvent = await correlateSecurityContext(event)
return logger.integrateSecurely(enrichedEvent)
}
}
```
This strengthens security while maintaining good user experience."
## Team Evolution
"Help me understand how we might guide our team toward greater effectiveness while honoring individual strengths."
Sample response:
"I notice natural team patterns wanting to emerge:
Sarah and Mike naturally complement each other in architecture discussions. Ana's analysis balances Tom's prototyping. And the whole team flows better when exploring before implementing.
We might guide collaboration through:
- Creating space for natural dialogue
- Balancing analysis and prototyping
- Following organic work rhythms
This lets the team evolve while maintaining harmony."
## Project Evolution
"Help me guide this project toward success while staying open to natural development."
Sample response:
"Rather than forcing a rigid plan, I notice three natural phases wanting to emerge:
1. Foundation (Weeks 1-3)
- Strengthen what works
- Address key friction points
- Prepare for growth
2. Development (Weeks 4-8)
- Let new patterns emerge
- Enhance growing strengths
- Guide natural evolution
3. Integration (Weeks 9-12)
- Connect the pieces
- Optimize the flow
- Refine the whole
This maintains momentum while staying flexible to what emerges."
## Conclusion
These examples demonstrate how to guide systems toward better states through expanded awareness rather than force. The key is working with natural tendencies while maintaining clear direction.
The best results come from understanding how systems want to evolve and gently guiding them toward greater effectiveness. This creates sustainable positive change across all aspects of development.
Remember these are starting points - experiment while staying attuned to how your systems want to develop. The best approaches emerge from genuine curiosity about natural evolution paths.
